It has been almost a year for me working on MineTrax project.
I started working on it on my free time with goal to make it some sort of suite for Minecraft survival based servers.

Though it has not completed development I am still releasing it as OSS for anyone interested.

<!--truncate-->

MineTrax is a web suite for Survival based servers. If you are a server owner I recommend you go thru its feature list.
Goal is to make it flexible, you can make it a public facing website or just use it private for analytics purpose.
