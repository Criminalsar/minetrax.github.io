            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been almost a year for me working on MineTrax project.
I started working on it on my free time with goal to make it some sort of suite for Minecraft survival based servers.</p><p>Though it has not completed development I am still releasing it as OSS for anyone interested.</p><p>MineTrax is a web suite for Survival based servers. If you are a server owner I recommend you go thru its feature list.
Goal is to make it flexible, you can make it a public facing website or just use it private for analytics purpose.</p>]]></content:encoded>
