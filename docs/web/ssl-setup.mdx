Currently your website should be running on `http://YOUR_DOMAIN` which is not secure.
In this section we will enable HTTPS on the web with help of [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) so you can access your site like `https://YOUR_DOMAIN`.

:::tip
If you are using CloudFlare as your DNS Provider. You can use it's free SSL feature by enabling it from their dashboard and ignore this section.

### Certbot Installation & Issue Certificate

Follow the install and certificate issue process for your webserver either Apache2 or Nginx.

<Tabs groupId="apache-nginx">
  <TabItem value="apache" label="Apache2">

Install Certbot and it's Apache2 plugin with apt.

```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-apache
```

Find what domain you have setup in your apache2 config file for minetrax `minetrax.conf`. In our case it was `your_domain.com` and `www.your_domain.com`.

Run the certbot to issue certificates for these domains. Make sure to replace `your_domain.com` with your own domain.

```
sudo certbot --apache -d your_domain.com -d www.your_domain.com
```

Finally incase it ask you if you want to Redirect all your traffic to https. Select the option to redirect (option 2 in most cases).

  <TabItem value="nginx" label="Nginx">

sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Run the certbot to issue certificates for these domains. Make sure to replace `your_domain.com` with your own domain.

```
sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain.com -d www.your_domain.com

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify Certbot Auto-Renewal

LetsEncrypt certificates are valid only for 3 months. 
The certbot package we installed takes care of this for us by adding a systemd timer that will run twice a day and automatically renew any certificate that's within thirty days of expiration.

Check the status of the timer.
```bash
sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
```

To check if auto renew will succeed.

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```
If you see no errors, you're all set.
